        <vra:description>This digital collection contains over 29,000 images of Russian sites, mostly buildings constructed from the Middle Ages to the present. The original film photographs were taken between 1970 and 2008 by a single photographer, Professor William Craft Brumfield of Tulane University. For the digital collection, the photographer scanned negatives to produce TIFFs. The TIFFs were sent to the University of Washington and converted to JPEGs, which were edited using Photoshop. Copyright to all images - digital, prints, and negatives - is owned by William Brumfield; to order a reproduction or inquire about permissions, contact the photographer at williambrumfield@gmail.com.</vra:description>
